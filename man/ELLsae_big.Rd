\usage{
ellsae_big(model, surveydata, censusdata, location_survey, n_boot = 50,
  seed, welfare.function, transfy, transfy_inv, output = "default",
  num_cores = 1, quantiles = c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1), clustermeans,
  location_census, save_boot = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{a model that is specified for the relationship betwenn the 
response varibale and the regressors. Model must be a linear model that can 
be processed by \code{lm()}}

\item{surveydata}{Smaller surveydata with additional response variable of 
interest. Will be used to estimate the linear model}

\item{censusdata}{The dataset in which a certain variable is supposed to be 
imputed}

\item{location_survey}{Name of location variable or vector for the survey 
data which is used for error correction and the location means (if 
\code{clustermeans} is specified)}

\item{n_boot}{Number of bootstrap samples used for the estimation, default is 
\code{n_boot = 50}}

\item{seed}{to make research reproducible a seed can be set. Simple 
\code{set.seed()} in R wont work as functions run in \code{C++}.
Seed is again randomized after running the function.}

\item{welfare.function}{Additionally a welfare function for the response can 
be specified}

\item{transfy}{function to transform the response y in the model}

\item{transfy_inv}{function for backtransformation of \code{transf}}

\item{output}{as "default" a list with ... is returned. Write "all" for all
possible outputs or specify outputs yourself in a vector.}

\item{num_cores}{utilizes the given number of cores to speed up the 
estimation. The number of cores can be determined by 
parallel::detectCores() - 1 or bigstatsr::nb_cores() that returnes only
physical cores.}

\item{quantiles}{vector of requested quantiles for the \code{summaryboot}
output as decimals between 0 and 1.}

\item{clustermeans}{Additional parameters for the regression based on 
location means calculated from the census data to account for the lack of 
information in a small survey}

\item{location_census}{name of location variable (string) in the census data 
which is used for error correction and location means. 
If \code{clustermeans} has an a variable and
\code{location_census} is missing, name of the \code{location_survey}
variable is tried.}

\item{save_boot}{logical indicator if the bootstraps of the response y are 
supposed to be saved as a CSV file under your current working direktory. 
The name is: BootstrapSampleELLsae-DATE.csv}
}
\value{
Use this function over \code{ellsae} if that one fails because the
census matrix is really large and you are trying to draw many bootstrap
samples. Generally \code{ellsae} is faster and more efficient.

The function takes the the typically smaller surveydata and uses the 
argument \code{model} to estimate a linear model of the type \code{lm()}. In case
the argument \code{clustermeans} is specified means from the cluster data for the given 
variables are calculated and merged with the survey databy cluster locations. These
new explanatory variables are also used for the estimation of the linear model. 

In the second step a C++ fuction takes over and calculates \code{nboot} predicted 
Y´s by using the betas from the first step to draw from a multivariate normal distribution
and draws indicidual and nested errors at random with replacement. If requested the Y´s 
are used to estimate the welfare function after which either the mean of the yhat or of the 
welfare fuctiom is returned.

The function returns a list with different objects. If \code{output} 
is left unspecified the estimated Y´s or welfare estimates \code{yhat}, 
the fit of the linear model \code{model_fit} and a summary of the bootstrap samples
\code{bootstrapCI} are returned.

If \code{output} is specified all the arguments given are returned. Next to the 
above the following inputs are possible, \code{surveydata} and \code{censusdata}
return the data frames used for the compution as some rows might be deleted due 
to NA handling and additional variables are created for \code{clustermeans}. 

Additionally the bootstrapped Y´s can be saved as a CSV if \code{save_yboot} is 
set equal \code{TRUE} and can be found under the current working directory as 
"Bootraps-of-Y.csv".

\description{
\code{ellsae_big} is a method for small area estimation used to 
impute a missing 
variable from a smaller survey dataset into a census. The imputation is based 
on a linear model and bootstrap samples.
