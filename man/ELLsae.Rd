\title{ELLsae: A package for small area estimation}
\description{
A method for small area estimation.
}
\details{
The method for small area estimation added by this package is largely based on an approach developed 
by C. Elbers, J. Lanjouw and P. Lanjouw (2003). It can be used to impute a missing variable 
from a smaller survey dataset into a census. The imputation is based on a 
linear model and bootstrap samples from a normal distribution. As of now the correction for heteroscedasticity 
is left omitted. +
