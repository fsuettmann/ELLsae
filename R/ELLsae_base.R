#' @title ELLsae_base
#' @description \code{ELLsae_base} is a method for small area estimation used to impute a missing 
#' variable from a smaller survey dataset into a census. The imputation is based 
#' on a linear model and bootstrap samples. 
#' 
#' @param model a model that is specified for the relationship betwenn the 
#'   response varibale and the regressors. Model must be a linear model that can 
#'   be processed by \code{lm()} 
#' @param surveydata Smaller surveydata with additional response variable of 
#'   interest. Will be used to estimate the linear model 
#' @param censusdata The dataset in which a certain variable is supposed to be 
#'   imputed 
#' @param location_survey Name of location variable or vector for the survey 
#'   data which is used for error correction and the location means (if 
#'   \code{mResponse} is specified) 
#' @param mResponse Additional parameters for the regression based on location 
#'   means calculated from the census data to account for the lack of 
#'   information in a small survey 
#' @param location_census name of location variable (string) in the census data 
#'   which is used for error correction and location means. If \code{mResponse} 
#'   is specified, but \code{location_census} is missing 
#' @param n_boot Number of bootstrap samples used for the estimation, default is 
#'   \code{n_boot = 50} 
#' @param welfare.function Additionally a welfare function for the response can 
#'   be specified 
#' @param parallel indicates if compution is supposed to be done in parallel to 
#'   improve speed 
#' @param output indicator for which output is requested as a list.
#' @param save_yboot logical indicator if the bootraps of the response y are 
#' supposed to be saved as a CSV file under your current working direktory. 
#' The name is: ...
#' @return The function takes the the typically smaller surveydata and uses the 
#' argument \code{model} to estimate a linear model of the type \code{lm()}. In case
#' the argument \code{mResponse} is specified means from the cluster data for the given 
#' variables are calculated and merged with the survey databy cluster locations. These
#' new explanatory variables are also used for the estimation of the linear model. 
#' 
#' In the second step a C++ fuction takes over and calculates \code{nboot} predicted 
#' Y´s by using the betas from the first step to draw from a multivariate normal distribution
#' and draws indicidual and nested errors at random with replacement. If requested the Y´s 
#' are used to estimate the welfare function after which either the mean of the yhat or of the 
#' welfare fuctiom is returned.
#' 
#' The function returns a list with different objects. If \code{output} 
#' is left unspecified the estimated Y´s or welfare estimates \code{yhat}, 
#' the fit of the linear model \code{model_fit} and a summary of the bootstrap samples
#' \code{bootstrapCI} are returned.
#' 
#' If \code{output} is specified all the arguments given are returned. Next to the 
#' above the following inputs are possible, \code{surveydata} and \code{censusdata}
#' return the data frames used for the compution as some rows might be deleted due 
#' to NA handling and additional variables are created for \code{mResponse}. 
#' 
#' Additionally the bootstrapped Y´s can be saved as a CSV if \code{save_yboot} is 
#' set equal \code{TRUE} and can be found under the current working directory as 
#' "Bootraps-of-Y.csv". 
#' @seealso Other small area estimation methods can also be found 
#' in the package \code{sae}.
