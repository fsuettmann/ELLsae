#' @title ellsae
#' @description \code{ellsae} is a method for small area estimation used to 
#' impute a missing variable from a smaller survey dataset into a census. 
#' The imputation is based on a linear model and bootstrap samples. 
#' 
#' @param model a model that is specified for the relationship betwenn the 
#'   response varibale and the regressors. Model must be a linear model that can 
#'   be processed by \code{lm()} 
#' @param surveydata Smaller surveydata with additional response variable of 
#'   interest. Will be used to estimate the linear model 
#' @param censusdata The dataset in which a certain variable is supposed to be 
#'   imputed 
#' @param location_survey Name of location variable or vector for the survey 
#'   data which is used for error correction and the location means (if 
#'   \code{clustermeans} is specified) 
#' @param n_boot Number of bootstrap samples used for the estimation, default is 
#'   \code{n_boot = 50} 
#' @param seed to make research reproducible a seed can be set. Simple 
#' \code{set.seed()} in R wont work as functions run in \code{C++}.
#' Seed is again randomized after running the function.
#' @param welfare.function Additionally a welfare function for the response can 
#'   be specified 
#' @param transfy function to transform the response y in the model
#' @param transfy_inv function for backtransformation of \code{transf}
#' @param output as "default" a list with ... is returned. Write "all" for all
#' possible outputs or specify outputs yourself in a vector.
#' @param num_cores utilizes the given number of cores to speed up the 
#' estimation. The number of cores can be determined by 
#' parallel::detectCores() - 1 or bigstatsr::nb_cores() that returnes only
#' physical cores. 
#' @param quantiles vector of requested quantiles for the \code{summaryboot}
#' output as decimals between 0 and 1.
#' @param clustermeans Additional parameters for the regression based on 
#' location means calculated from the census data to account for the lack of 
#' information in a small survey 
#' @param location_census name of location variable (string) in the census data 
#'   which is used for error correction and location means. 
#'   If \code{clustermeans} has an a variable and
#'   \code{location_census} is missing, name of the \code{location_survey}
#'   variable is tried.
#' @param save_boot logical indicator if the bootstraps of the response y are 
#' supposed to be saved as a CSV file under your current working direktory. 
#' The name is: BootstrapSampleELLsae-DATE.csv
#' @return The function takes the the typically smaller surveydata and uses the 
#' argument \code{model} to estimate a linear model of the type \code{lm()}. 
#' In case the argument \code{clustermeans} is specified means from the cluster 
#' data for the given variables are calculated and merged with the survey 
#' data by cluster locations. These new explanatory variables are also used for 
#' the estimation of the linear model. 
#' 
#' In the second step a C++ fuction takes over and calculates \code{n_boot} 
#' predicted Y´s by using the betas from the first step to draw from a 
#' multivariate normal distributionand draws indicidual and nested errors at 
#' random with replacement. If requested the Y´s are used to estimate the 
#' welfare function after which either the mean of the yhat or of the welfare 
#' fuctiom is returned.
#' 
#' The function returns a list with different objects. If \code{output} 
#' is left unspecified the estimated Y´s or welfare estimates \code{yhat}, 
#' the fit of the linear model \code{model_fit} and a summary of the bootstrap 
#' samples
#' \code{bootstrapCI} are returned.
#' 
#' If \code{output} is specified all the arguments given are returned. 
#' Next to the 
#' above the following inputs are possible, \code{surveydata} and 
#' \code{censusdata}
#' return the data frames used for the compution as some rows might be 
#' deleted due 
#' to NA handling and additional variables are created for \code{clustermeans}. 
#' 
#' Additionally the bootstrapped Y´s can be saved as a CSV if 
#' \code{save_yboot} is 
#' set equal \code{TRUE} and can be found under the current working directory as 
#' "Bootraps-of-Y.csv". 
#' @seealso Other small area estimation methods can also be found 
#' in the package \code{sae}.
