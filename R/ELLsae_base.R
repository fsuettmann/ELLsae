#' @title ELLsae
#' @description Beschreibung der Funktion
#'
#' \code{ELLsae} is a method for small area estimation used to impute a missing 
#' variable from a smaller survey dataset into a census. The imputation is based 
#' on a linear model and bootstrap samples. 
#' 
#' @param model a model that is specified for the relationship betwenn the 
#'   response varibale and the regressors. Model must be a linear model that can 
#'   be processed by \code{lm()} 
#' @param surveydata Smaller surveydata with additional response variable of 
#'   interest. Will be used to estimate the linear model 
#' @param censusdata The dataset in which a certain variable is supposed to be 
#'   imputed 
#' @param location_survey Name of location variable or vector for the survey 
#'   data which is used for error correction and the location means (if 
#'   \code{mResponse} is specified) 
#' @param mResponse Additional parameters for the regression based on location 
#'   means calculated from the census data to account for the lack of 
#'   information in a small survey 
#' @param location_census name of location variable (string) in the census data 
#'   which is used for error correction and location means. If \code{mResponse} 
#'   is specified, but \code{location_census} is missing 
#' @param n_boot Number of bootstrap samples used for the estimation, default is 
#'   \code{n_boot = 50} 
#' @param welfare.function Additionally a welfare function for the response can 
#'   be specified 
#' @param parallel indicates if compution is supposed to be done in parallel to 
#'   improve speed 
#' @export yes
#' @return The function returns a vector of the imputed variable as well as ... 
#' @references A 
#' @seealso Other SAE methods can also be found in the package \code{sae}.
